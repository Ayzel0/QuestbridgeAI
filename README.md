# README

Our solution is called Questbridge AI, a chatbot trained on real college data to provide access to information for students in need, particularly those that are first-generation and or/from low-income households. We hope to further improve equity and accessibility for college admissions.

Team members:
- Andrew Lee, Georgetown University, azl9@georgetown.edu
- Lucy Wu, Johns Hopkins University, lwu72@jhu.edu

This solution can serve students from Johns Hopkins University (for hackathon track purposes), but is designed to work with any school listed on the Questbridge website: https://www.questbridge.org

Our website is viewable here: http://questbridgeai.co/about

Please feel free to contact us with any questions! We hope you enjoy talking with our chatbot.
